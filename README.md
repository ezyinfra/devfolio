### Customization

1. **Update data.json**

The main data source for the portfolio is a JSON file located at ***public/data.json***. Edit this file to reflect your personal information, skills, experience, projects, and other sections.


2. **Styling**

Tailwind CSS is used for styling. You can customize the styles in the tailwind.config.js file and add your own styles in styles/globals.css.

### Deployment
